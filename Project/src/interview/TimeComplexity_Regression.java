 How to Reduce Time Complexity in Automation?
Use Efficient Locators â€“ Prefer By.id() or By.cssSelector() over By.xpath() for better performance.
Avoid Unnecessary Loops â€“ Minimize the use of nested loops in automation scripts.
Parallel Execution â€“ Run tests in parallel using tools like TestNG, Selenium Grid, or Cypress.
Explicit Waits Over Implicit Waits â€“ Use WebDriverWait instead of Thread.sleep() to reduce unnecessary delays.
Use Data-Driven Testing Wisely â€“ Optimize how test data is loaded to prevent slow iterations.
Conclusion
Time complexity in automation testing helps optimize test execution speed, ensuring that test scripts scale efficiently 
as the application grows. Choosing the right approach can significantly reduce execution time and enhance performance. ðŸš€
