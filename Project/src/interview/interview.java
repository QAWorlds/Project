		Scenario-Based Questions: 

 Scenario 1: Describe a situation where you had to perform root cause analysis for a critical production issue. How did you identify the underlying cause and prevent similar issues in the future?

 Scenario 2: How do you determine if a post-production defect was missed by the QA team or caused by the development team?

Scenario 3: Suppose there are 100 manual test cases. How would you determine which ones to automate?

Scenario 4: How would you handle a situation where a critical bug is found at the end of a sprint?

Scenario 5: Describe how you would design an automated testing strategy for a new feature.

Behavioral-Based Questions:

Question 1: Tell me about a time when you had to work under pressure to meet a tight deadline. How did you prioritize your testing tasks?

Question 2: Describe a situation where you found a critical bug that others had missed. How did you identify it, and what steps did you take to ensure it was resolved?

Question 3: How do you ensure effective communication and collaboration between QA, development, and other cross-functional teams?

Question 4: In an application currently in production, one module of code is being modified. Is it necessary to retest the whole application, or is it enough to just test the functionality associated with that module?

Question 5: How do you prioritize your tasks in a fast-paced Agile environment?

Question 6: Give an example of a time when you improved the testing process in your team.

Manual testing:
Question1: What is Manual Testing?
Answer: Manual testing is a software testing process where a human tester manually executes test cases to identify defects or bugs in a software application. It involves testing the software without using automated tools or scripts.

Question2: When to do Manual Testing?
Answer: Manual testing is typically performed during:

1.⁠ ⁠Early stages of software development
2.⁠ ⁠Exploratory testing
3.⁠ ⁠Usability testing
4.⁠ ⁠User acceptance testing (UAT)
5.⁠ ⁠Regression testing (for small changes)
6.⁠ ⁠Complex business logic testing
7.⁠ ⁠Testing requiring human judgment

Question3: Why do Manual Testing?
Answer: Manual testing is necessary because:

1.⁠ ⁠Human intuition and creativity can identify unique defects
2.⁠ ⁠Complex scenarios require human judgment
3.⁠ ⁠Automated tools may miss certain defects
4.⁠ ⁠Initial testing requires human involvement
5.⁠ ⁠User experience and usability testing require human feedback

Question4: How to do Manual Testing?
Answer: Manual testing involves:

1.⁠ ⁠Reviewing requirements and specifications
2.⁠ ⁠Creating test plans and test cases
3.⁠ ⁠Executing test cases
4.⁠ ⁠Reporting defects
5.⁠ ⁠Retesting fixed defects
6.⁠ ⁠Validating test results

Question5: Advantages of Manual Testing:

1.⁠ ⁠Human intuition and creativity
2.⁠ ⁠Flexibility in testing approach
3.⁠ ⁠No automation tool costs
4.⁠ ⁠Quick testing for small changes
5.⁠ ⁠Effective for complex business logic
6.⁠ ⁠Improved user experience testing

Question6: Disadvantages of Manual Testing:

1.⁠ ⁠Time-consuming and labor-intensive
2.⁠ ⁠Prone to human error
3.⁠ ⁠Difficult to test complex systems
4.⁠ ⁠Regression testing challenges
5.⁠ ⁠Limited test coverage
6.⁠ ⁠High testing costs for large projects
